    This is a copy of bc_interpolation otuside of the main function to be able 
    to call it without the other inputs to adjust linefull.depth as it says in 
    idl.

    This function interpolates the depth(filter) from Casagrande+14

    The tables from Casagrande+14 usually come for all different values of 
    E(B-V).
    We have already selected values of E(B-V) = [0.00, 0.12, 0.24, 0.36, 0.48] 
    and first select the appropriate one. For this, we have a FITS file with 
    precomputed depth values for several filters.

    We do a tri-linear interpolation with teff, logg, and fe_h
    and return the values of depth in a dictionary

    For this, we find the 2 closest entries in teff, then fe_h, and then logg
    with this set of 8 points, we can perform a trilinear interpolation
