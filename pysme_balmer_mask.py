"""We need to synthesize the Balmer lines only in order to compute the regions

            The spectra of the non-balmer run created in the Synthesize run 
            previous. We take the synthes. spectra from it to compare to the 
            balmer spectra we just produced to compare to cmax with the balmer 
            run in "(sme_synth_array-balmer_synth_array)**2 < chimax"

            The spectra we mainly use to compare to the variables of chimax and 
            cmin to ensure we use only appropriate spectra.

            The start of the balmer line. This varies more wildly due to 
            varying inputs and ends up with many similar linemasks overlapping.
        line_en: 
            The same as line_st, but for the end of the mask.
